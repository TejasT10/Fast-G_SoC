# FAST-G
This library contains implementations of various Graph Optimization and Search algorithms in C++. This project is under the Seasons of Code Initiative by the Web n Coding Club, IIT Bombay.

# Note
Various segments of the project have been presented in an individual file manner in this repository, as opposed to a combined C++ file containing all algorithms. This has been done on account of the absence of a unified header file that can be used on any input, as of yet. The issue is being worked on and shall soon be resolved.
